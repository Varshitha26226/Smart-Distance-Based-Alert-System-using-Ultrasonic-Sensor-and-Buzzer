# Smart Distance-Based Alert System using Ultrasonic Sensor and Buzzer on Wokwi 

This project simulates a smart alert system using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, LED, and buzzer. Built and tested in the Wokwi simulator, it demonstrates how proximity detection can trigger safety alerts in real-world scenarios.

# Features
- Detects objects within 20 cm
- Activates buzzer and LED for close-range alerts
- Filters out false readings above 300 cm
- Serial output for distance monitoring
- Timeout handling for reliable detection

# Components Used
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Active Buzzer  
- LED  
- Arduino Uno  
- Wokwi Simulator

# Simulation
Tested in [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/), with virtual object placement and real-time distance feedback.  
To simulate, place an object within 10â€“20 cm of the sensor to trigger alerts.



# Use Case
This system mimics industrial safety alerts where both visual and auditory signals are used to warn operators of nearby hazards. It can be extended to parking assist, robotics, or factory automation.
